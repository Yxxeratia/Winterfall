            Alferelia was an isolated region ruled by the 1st King with a population just merely 
            in the thounsands. Despite this, it was still a well-developed nation for its era.
            That was until one particular winter arrived along with the inexplicably longest snowing period
            in the nation's history.

            Months turned into years and years into decades but the snowing never came to a halt. This consquently 
            stunted the growth of the nation and resulted in the deaths of nearly half of its population. The King, who
            was later found out to have been studying dark magic behind closed doors, inadvertently leaked his studies to 
            outsiders. This caused an uproar among the citizens and they started to turn on each other. The internal war lasted
            for many years and only a few survivors remained. They traveled long distances and seeked refuge in other lands.

            Years passed and everything seems to have subsided. Everyone is now living their normal lives... until one fateful winter
            where it looks as if the snow that once instilled fear and terror into the Alferelians has re-emerged... now in the 
            other nations.
